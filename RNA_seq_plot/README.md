# Volcano Plot Script

This script generates a volcano plot for RNA-seq gene expression analysis. It visualizes the differential expression of genes between two conditions based on log2 fold change (log2fc) and p-values.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following software and R packages installed:

- R (version 1.3.959 or higher)
- tidyverse
- RColorBrewer
- ggrepel

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Place your gene expression data file in the specified location or update the `input_file` variable with the correct path to your data file.

3. Update the `output_file` variable with the desired path and file name for the generated plot.

4. Open an R script or console and run the script:

   ```R
   # Set the paths for the input data file and the output plot file
   input_file <- "path/to/input/file.csv"
   output_file <- "path/to/output/plot.pdf"

   # Call the function to generate the volcano plot
   generate_volcano_plot(input_file, output_file)
